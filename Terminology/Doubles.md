A data type that represents numbers with decimal points and provides higher precision than standard 32-bit floats. Doubles occupy 64 bits of memory, allowing them to store numbers with more significant digits and a greater range than 32-bit floats.

### Key Characteristics of Doubles:

1. **Higher Precision**: With 64 bits, doubles offer about **15-16 decimal places of precision**, which is useful for scientific calculations, financial data, and any application requiring high accuracy.
2. **Greater Range**: Doubles can represent both extremely large and extremely small numbers, which makes them versatile for a wide range of applications where precision is critical.

### Comparison with Floats:

- **Floats (32-bit)**: Around 7 decimal places of precision.
- **Doubles (64-bit)**: Around 15-16 decimal places of precision.

In many programming languages, doubles are the default floating-point type because they offer better precision and range.

### Examples in Code:

1. **In Python** (floats are double-precision by default):
```
python
precise_number = 0.1234567890123456  # Stored as a double (64-bit float)
```
2. **In Java**
```
double largeDecimal = 3.141592653589793;  // 64-bit double
float lessPreciseDecimal = 3.14159f;  // 32-bit float
```
