```

## Common Options
- `-a`: Shows all files (including hidden)
- `-l`: Long format listing
- `-h`: Human-readable sizes
- `-R`: Recursive listing
- `-r`: Reverse order
- `-S`: Sort by file size
- `-t`: Sort by modification time
- `-F`: Classify entries (adds indicators)
- `-d`: List directories themselves, not contents
- `-i`: Show inode numbers
- `-n`: Show numeric UID and GID
- `-X`: Sort alphabetically by extension

## Examples

### Basic Listing
```bash
ls
```
Shows visible files and directories in current directory

### Show All Files Including Hidden
```bash
ls -a
```

### Long Format Listing
```bash
ls -l
```
Shows detailed information:
- File permissions
- Number of links
- Owner name
- Group name
- File size
- Timestamp
- Name

### Human-Readable Sizes
```bash
ls -lh
```
Shows sizes in KB, MB, GB instead of bytes

### Sort by Time
```bash
ls -lt
```
Lists files sorted by modification time

### Recursive Listing
```bash
ls -R
```
Lists subdirectories recursively

### Combined Options
```bash
ls -lahR
```
- Shows all files (-a)
- In long format (-l)
- With human-readable sizes (-h)
- Recursively (-R)

## Output Format (Long Listing)
```
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Jan 1 12:00 directory_name
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Jan 1 12:00 file_name
```

### Format Explanation
1. File type and permissions (10 characters)
2. Number of hard links
3. Owner username
4. Group name
5. File size
6. Last modification time
7. File/directory name

## Common Use Cases
1. View directory contents:
```bash
ls ~/Documents
```

2. Find large files:
```bash
ls -lhS
```

3. Find recently modified files:
```bash
ls -lt
```

4. List only directories:
```bash
ls -d */
```

5. Show hidden configuration files:
```bash
ls -a ~/.config
```

## Tips
1. Use tab completion with ls
2. Combine options for specific needs
3. Use wildcards with ls (*.txt, etc.)
4. Use --color=auto for colored output

## Related Commands
- `tree`: Shows directory structure in tree format
- `dir`: Similar to ls (GNU version)
- `vdir`: Verbose directory listing

## Common Issues
1. Permission denied
   - Solution: Check directory permissions
   
2. Too many files
   - Solution: Use pagination (`ls | less`)

3. Unreadable timestamps
   - Solution: Use `--full-time` option

## Environment Variables
- `LS_COLORS`: Defines colors for file types
- `LANG`: Affects sort order
- `TZ`: Affects timestamp display
