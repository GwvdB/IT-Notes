A data type that has only two possible values, typically represented as `true` or `false`. Booleans are used to evaluate conditions and control the flow of programs by determining whether specific code blocks should be executed.

## Key Characteristics of Booleans:

1. **Binary Nature**: Booleans represent a binary choice or state â€” either `true` (yes, on, or 1) or `false` (no, off, or 0).
2. **Conditional Logic**: Often used in conditional statements (like `if`, `while`, or `for` loops) to decide which path the program should follow based on certain conditions.

## Common Uses of Booleans:

- **Conditionals**: Booleans are often the result of comparisons and logical operations.
    - Example: `is_raining = true` and `is_sunny = false`
    - `if (is_raining) { // execute code if true }`
- **Comparisons**: Operations that check for equality or inequality return Boolean values.
    - Example: `5 > 3` results in `true`, while `3 == 4` results in `false`.
- **Logical Operations**: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operations are used to combine or invert Boolean values.
    - Example: `(5 > 3) && (3 < 4)` results in `true` because both conditions are true.

## Examples in Code:
1. In Python
```
is_logged_in = True
if is_logged_in:
    print("Welcome back!")
```
2. In JavaScript:
```
let isAvailable = false;
if (!isAvailable) {
    console.log("Item is out of stock");
}
```
