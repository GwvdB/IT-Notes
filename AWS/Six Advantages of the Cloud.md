## 1. Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense
Trading up front costs for a "Pay On-Demand" service means that you only pay for what you use.

## 2. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale
The more users on the Cloud, the lower the cost for all involved. This means popularity is key here.

## 3. Stop Guessing Capacity
Since there are no longer up front costs and contracts, this means that all services can be scaled up and down (or out and in) as needed.

## 4. Increase Speed and Agility
Rescources can be launched and stopped at the click of a button depending on demands

## 5. Stop Spending Money on Running and Maintaining Data Centres
AWS runs and maintains the Data Centres so that the client can focus on their customers.

## 6. Go Global in Minutes
Due to the ease of AWS Console, apps can be deployed in minutes in various regions around the world.
