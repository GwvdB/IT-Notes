To write code, you need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where you can enter commands in a programming language. Once written, code is saved as a file, and the computer interprets or compiles this file to execute the commands.

## Steps in Writing Code
1. Choose a programming language.
2. Write code in a text editor.
3. Test your code by running it in an interpreter or compiler.
4. Debug any errors.

## Syntax
Code is written in varying Syntax which is a set of rules similar to grammar. Each language has its own set of rules and using incorrect Syntax can cause errors in the code. Usually the IDE can locate the error and will highlight it.
