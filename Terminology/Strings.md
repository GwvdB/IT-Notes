A data type used in programming to represent a sequence of characters, which can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Strings are typically enclosed in quotes (single or double) and can be stored in variables.

## Key Characteristics of Strings:
1. **Sequence of Characters**: Strings are made up of one or more characters, which can include any printable or non-printable characters.
2. **Immutable or Mutable**: Depending on the programming language, strings may be immutable (cannot be changed after creation, like in Python) or mutable (can be modified, like in some implementations of JavaScript).
3. **Enclosed in Quotes**: Strings are generally enclosed in quotation marks. For example:
    - In Python: `"Hello, world!"` or `'Hello, world!'`
    - In JavaScript: `"Hello, world!"`

## Common Operations on Strings:
- **Concatenation**: Joining two or more strings together (e.g., `"Hello, " + "world!"` results in `"Hello, world!"`).
- **Substring**: Extracting a portion of a string (e.g., getting the first three characters of `"Hello"` results in `"Hel"`).
- **Length**: Determining the number of characters in a string (e.g., the length of `"Hello"` is 5).
- **Searching**: Finding the position of a specific character or substring within a string.

## Example in Code:
Hereâ€™s an example in Python:
```
greeting = "Hello, world!"  # A string variable
print(greeting)             # Outputs: Hello, world!
```

## String vs Integer:
Numbers should not be put in quotations as this will confuse the computer. When using numbers for a calculation, always always use [[Integer]].
