The process of linking or joining two or more items together end-to-end. In programming, concatenation usually refers to combining strings to form a single, longer string.

## How Concatenation Works:
- **String Concatenation**: The most common form of concatenation, where two or more strings are joined to produce a new string.
    
- For example, in many languages:
```
"Hello, " + "world!" # Results in: "Hello, world!"
```  
Here, the `+` operator is used to concatenate two strings.
    
- **Concatenation of Other Data Types**: Some programming languages allow concatenation of different types (e.g., numbers with strings) by converting them to a common type (often a string) before concatenating.    

## Common Operators for Concatenation:
- **`+`**: Used in many languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- **`&`**: Used in some languages, like Visual Basic.
- **`.concat()` method**: In some languages, like JavaScript, there's a dedicated `.concat()` function for strings.
