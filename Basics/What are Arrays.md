An array is a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory. Arrays allow you to store and access multiple values using indices.

- Integers
- Strings
- 2D Arrays (When an Array is placed within an Array)

All the information contained are related which helps find specific information (manually or with a search).

## Creation

There are two ways to create an Array:
- Populate first --> add the elements during creation
- Populate later --> create an array of a specific, unchangeable size to be populated by end-users. 
The type of the Array must be determined immediately and this cannot be mixed.
