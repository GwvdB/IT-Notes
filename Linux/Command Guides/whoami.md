## Common Usage Patterns

```

### Identify User in Scripts
```bash
# Get the current user and use it in a script
current_user=$(whoami)
echo "Performing action as user: $current_user"
```

### Verify User Permissions
```bash
# Check if the current user has the required permissions
if [ "$(whoami)" = "root" ]; then
    echo "This action requires root privileges."
fi
```
