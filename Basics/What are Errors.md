Errors (or bugs) occur when code does not execute correctly. They can be **syntax errors** (incorrect grammar) , **runtime errors** (occur while code is running) or **logic errors** (not a desired outcome).

## Syntax

This is the easiest to solve as the error is highlighted by the IDE as a failure to meet the programming rules. This will then restrict the code from continuing to run.

## Runtime

These don't appear until after the code is run. This is only when code is unable to run in a reasonable time. The most common form is an [[What are Loops|infinte loop]].

**IMPORTANT:** It's best to test incrementally so that bugs are located as the code is written.
