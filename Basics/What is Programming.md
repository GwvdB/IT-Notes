Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the code that instructs a computer on how to perform specific tasks. It's the foundation for creating applications, websites, and all digital systems we use daily.

It's very much like spoon feeding a computer on how it has to complete its tasks by giving it specific instructions. This can be done by translating into machine language (binary code) by using programming languages.

## Languages
Different languages are used for different tasks which comes down to GPL vs. DSL.
- General-Purpose Language: Used across application domains
- Domain-Specific Languages: Specialises to a particular domain - e.g. HTML for websites.

There are multiple levels to programming languages. The lower the level the more similar to machine code the language.
