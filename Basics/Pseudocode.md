Pseudocode is a way of planning a program using plain language to outline the logic without worrying about specific syntax. It helps programmers organize thoughts before coding.

### Example of Pseudocode for Sorting

vbnet
```
1. For each element in the list:
	a. Compare it with adjacent elements.
	b. Swap if elements are out of order.
2. Repeat until the list is sorted.
