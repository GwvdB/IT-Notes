A data type that includes all whole numbers, both positive and negative, as well as zero. This includes numbers like 11, −124−124, and 30013001, but does not include numbers with fractions or decimals, such as 2.52.5 or −3.14−3.14.

## Types of Integers:

1. **Positive Integers**: Whole numbers greater than zero (e.g. 1,2,3,…).
2. **Negative Integers**: Whole numbers less than zero (e.g. −1,−2,−3,…).
3. **Zero**: Zero (0) is also considered an integer and is neither positive nor negative.

## Properties of Integers:

- Integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e. adding, subtracting, or multiplying two integers will always produce an integer).
- Division of two integers may not always result in an integer, as it can produce a fraction (e.g. 5/2=2.5).
