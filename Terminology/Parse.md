The process of analyzing a sequence of text or code to understand its structure according to a specific set of rules, typically the syntax of a programming language or data format. Parsing breaks down the text into components, allowing the extraction of relevant information and the detection of any errors.

## How Parsing Works:

Parsing usually involves two main steps:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Breaking down the input text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, symbols).
2. **Syntactic Analysis**: Analyzing these tokens according to grammatical rules to determine the structure and meaning of the input. This often generates a **parse tree** or **abstract syntax tree (AST)** that represents the hierarchical structure of the code or text.

## Common Uses of Parsing:

- **Compilers and Interpreters**: Convert source code into an executable format by parsing it to verify syntax and structure.
- **Data Extraction**: Parse structured data formats like JSON, XML, or CSV to retrieve specific information.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Break down and interpret sentences to understand meaning in human language processing.

## Example:

When a compiler parses the line:
`x = 5 + 3`

It:
1. Breaks it into tokens: `x`, `=`, `5`, `+`, `3`.
2. Checks the syntax to confirm itâ€™s a valid assignment statement.
3. Builds an abstract syntax tree, which represents the structure for further interpretation or compilation.
