An operation that returns the remainder after dividing one number by another. It is typically represented by the `%` symbol in many programming languages.

## How the Modulus Operation Works:
- When you perform `a % b`, the modulus operation divides `a` by `b` and returns the remainder of that division.

For example:

- 10 % 3=1 (because 10/3 is 3 with a remainder of 1)
- 15 % 4=3 (because 15/4 is 3 with a remainder of 3)

## Common Uses of the Modulus Operation:
1. **Checking Even or Odd Numbers**: A number `n` is even if `n % 2 == 0`, and odd if `n % 2 == 1`.
2. **Cycles and Patterns**: Used in programming to cycle through indices or patterns, like rotating through days of the week.
3. **Divisibility Checks**: To check if one number divides another perfectly, you can check if `a % b == 0`.
