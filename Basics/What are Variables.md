Variables store data that programs use and manipulate. They are essential for keeping track of values that change, such as numbers, strings, or objects.

Variables are like storage containers much much like a box that can be changed and modified. Each variable has a type, name and a singular piece of information.

Variables are required by a program to store any user imputed information. They can be used to create variability.
